## Values received by this script:
# To = $1 / Slack channel or user to send the message to, specified in the Zabbix web interface; "@username" or "#channel"
# Subject = $2 / subject of the message sent by Zabbix; by default, it is usually something like "(Problem|Resolved): Lack of free swap space on Zabbix server"
# Message = $3 / message body sent by Zabbix; by default, it is usually approximately 4 lines detailing the specific trigger involved
# URL = $4 / Slack.com incoming webhook URL to which alerts will be sent to
# Proxy = $5 (optional) / proxy host including port (such as "example.com:8080")

# Get the user/channel ($1), subject ($2), and message ($3), and Slack incoming webhook URL ($4)
